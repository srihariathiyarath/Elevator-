 The elevator serves floors from zero (the basement) to the top floor. 
 It is an old elevator and itâ€™s not automatic. When people get in the elevator, they enter their desired floor number.
 Several numbers can be requested at a time. After all numbers have been entered, the door is closed by pressing the close door number (the return key).
Each time the door closes, the elevator checks to see if there are any floors in the current direction (up or down).
If there are, then it services these floors first, starting with the closest one to the cur- rent floor.
If there are no floors requiring stops in the current directions, it checks the opposite direc- tion, again servicing the floor closest to the current floor. 
If the elevator is not moving (direction STOP), then it services up requests before down requests.
Each time, the elevator arrives at a floor, new passengers can get on and request a floor. 
The new requests are added to the ones still pending, and the elevator again evaluates which floor will be processed first.
